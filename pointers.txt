1. Wild Pointer: A wild pointer is a pointer that is declared but not assigned a valid address. It points to some random, unknown memory location.

2. Dangling Pointer: A dangling pointer is a pointer that once pointed to valid memory location but no longer does. The memory it refers to has been freed or gone out of scope.

3. NULL Pointer: It is a pointer whose value is NULL (or 0 internally), meaning it is guaranteed not to point to any object or function.
